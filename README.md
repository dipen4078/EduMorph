It generates structured study schedules, explains concepts with tailored videos, and evaluates your understanding through dynamic quizzes. With continuous feedback and smart strategies for deeper comprehension, Edumorph transforms learning into an engaging, adaptive, and highly effective journey.

This project is designed to generate PowerPoint slides, voice explanations, and video presentations from a given topic and subtopic using the Groq API for natural language processing.

# Features:

1)Slide Generation: Automatically create PowerPoint slides on a given topic/subtopic.

2)Audio Explanation: Generate audio explanations for each slide using the gTTS library.

3)Video Creation: Convert PowerPoint slides into images and create a synchronized video using the moviepy library.

4)MCQ Test: Generate multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for testing knowledge on the topic.

5)PDF Generation: Generate detailed explanation and example and stores it to local disk as a PDF for in depth learning.

# Technologies Used:

  - Python
  
  - Flask: For web-based interaction and user interface.
  
  - Groq: For generating text content (slides and MCQs).
  
  - gTTS: For converting text to speech (audio explanations).
  
  - moviepy: For combining slides and audio into video.
  
  - FPDF: For generating PDFs with explanations.
  
  - pdf2image: For converting .pptx slides to images
